## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that describe the central or typical value of a dataset. They provide a single value that represents the center or midpoint of the data distribution. The main measures of central tendency include the following:

1. **Mean:**
   - The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and then dividing by the total number of values. It is denoted by the symbol "μ" for the population mean and "x̄" (x-bar) for the sample mean. The formula for the mean is:
     \[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}} \]

2. **Median:**
   - The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. To find the median, the dataset is first arranged in ascending order, and then the middle value is identified. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

3. **Mode:**
   - The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal). If no value repeats, the dataset is said to have no mode.

Each measure of central tendency has its own strengths and weaknesses and is appropriate for different types of data distributions:

- The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and may not be a good representation of the central tendency if the data is skewed or has outliers.
- The median is less sensitive to outliers and is a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions or datasets with outliers.
- The mode is useful for categorical data and can also be used for numerical data, but it may not be unique or may not exist in some datasets.

In summary, the choice of measure of central tendency depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the specific context of the analysis. It is often useful to consider multiple measures of central tendency to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data.
