In statistics, a variable is a characteristic or attribute that can take on different values. Variables are used to represent data and can be classified into different types based on their nature and the kind of values they can assume. Here are the main types of variables in statistics:

1. **Categorical Variables:**
   - Categorical variables represent characteristics that can be divided into categories or groups. These variables can be further divided into two subtypes:
     - **Nominal Variables:** Nominal variables represent categories with no inherent order or ranking. Examples include gender (male, female), marital status (single, married, divorced), and eye color (blue, brown, green).
     - **Ordinal Variables:** Ordinal variables represent categories with a natural order or ranking. However, the differences between the categories may not be uniform. Examples include education level (high school, college, graduate), income level (low, medium, high), and Likert scale responses (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree).

2. **Numerical Variables:**
   - Numerical variables represent quantities or numerical values that can be measured and compared. Numerical variables can be further divided into two subtypes:
     - **Discrete Variables:** Discrete variables represent whole numbers or counts and can only take on specific, distinct values. Examples include the number of children in a family, the number of cars owned by a household, and the number of students in a class.
     - **Continuous Variables:** Continuous variables represent measurements that can take on any value within a range. These variables can be measured with precision and may include fractional or decimal values. Examples include height, weight, temperature, and time.

Understanding the types of variables is important for selecting appropriate statistical techniques for analysis, as different types of variables require different methods of analysis and interpretation. Additionally, understanding the nature of variables helps researchers make meaningful conclusions and inferences from data.
