Variance and standard deviation are measures of dispersion that quantify the spread of data points around the mean. Both variance and standard deviation are used to understand the variability or scatter of data points in a dataset.

### Population Variance and Standard Deviation:

1. **Population Variance (\( \sigma^2 \))**:
   - The population variance is the average of the squared deviations of each data point from the population mean. It is calculated using the formula:

   - Where \( N \) is the population size, \( x_i \) is each individual data point, and \( \mu \) is the population mean.

2. **Population Standard Deviation (\( \sigma \))**:
   - The population standard deviation is the square root of the population variance. It is calculated using the formula:

### Sample Variance and Standard Deviation:

1. **Sample Variance (\( s^2 \))**:
   - The sample variance is similar to the population variance but uses the sample mean (\( \bar{x} \)) instead of the population mean. It is calculated using the formula:

   - Where \( n \) is the sample size, \( x_i \) is each individual data point, and \( \bar{x} \) is the sample mean.

2. **Sample Standard Deviation (\( s \))**:
   - The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance. It is calculated using the formula:

### Differences Between Population and Sample:

- Population variance and standard deviation are used when data is collected from an entire population.
- Sample variance and standard deviation are used when data is collected from a sample of the population.
- The denominator in the formulas for sample variance and standard deviation is \( n - 1 \) instead of \( n \). This adjustment corrects for the bias in the estimation of the population variance when using a sample.

### Relation between Variance, Standard Deviation and Spread of Curve
  **Variance** - A higher variance indicates that data points are more spread out from the mean, resulting in a wider distribution.
  **Standard Deviation** - A higher standard deviation means data points are more spread out from the mean, resulting in a wider distribution.

In summary, both population and sample variance and standard deviation are important measures of dispersion used in statistical analysis to understand the spread of data points in a dataset.
-Variance and standard deviation quantify the amount of variability or dispersion in a dataset.
-They provide insight into how tightly or widely data points are clustered around the mean.
-Higher variance and standard deviation indicate a wider spread of data points, while lower values indicate a narrower spread.
